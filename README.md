GitHub Profile README
Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I want to express my concern regarding the unauthorized cloning of my projects by individuals who were (or worse, were not even) granted 'view only' access but chose to act otherwise. 
This situation has made me feel violated.

Please note that this GitHub profile serves as my personal project portfolio, and access is restricted to VIEWING only, with my explicit permission. No other permissions are granted.

If you would like to view my projects, please send me your email address and request access so I can have it granted, but only if you agree to this condition. 

Your understanding of this condition is appreciated.

Thank you!

   "Presenting a project publicly is not a permission to be violated by evaluating experts, especially, by unauthorized cloners."

- 👋 Hi, I’m Jaemily.                  
- 👀 A member and a Junior Software Engineer in Trivut, DevJedis group.

- 💞️ I’m looking to have my extra time utilized.
- 📫 Maybe I can work for/with you.


  ⚡  I noticed my works were cloned 4x already even if I was prohibiting it, and it was just yesterday since I uploaded them. I figured that the only way to truly prevent unauthorized cloning is to make them private.
 So please, kindly communicate through my e-mail and send me your GitHub e-mail if you need to `see` my portfolio, so I can let you `see` them. Thank you! 😄
