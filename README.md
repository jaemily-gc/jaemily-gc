  ⚡  I noticed my works were cloned 4x already even if I was prohibiting it, and it was just yesterday since I uploaded them. The only way to truly prevent unauthorized cloning is to make them private.
  😄  So please, kindly communicate through my e-mail and send me your GitHub e-mail if you need to `see` my portfolio, so I can let you `see` them. Thank you!
